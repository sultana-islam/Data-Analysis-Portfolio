# Data Wrangling for City of Vancouver Datasets

## Project Overview
This project focuses on data wrangling techniques applied to the City of Vancouver datasets. The primary goal was to transform raw, messy data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and integration using AWS cloud services and data processing tools.

## Datasets
The project worked with multiple datasets from the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal:

1. **Park Facilities Data**: Information about recreational facilities in Vancouver parks
2. **Neighborhood Demographics**: Population and demographic information for Vancouver neighborhoods
3. **Community Center Usage**: Attendance and program participation at community centers

These datasets initially contained various data quality issues including missing values, inconsistent formatting, duplicate records, and incompatible data types.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Assessment
- Conducted a thorough examination of all datasets to identify:
  - Missing values and their patterns
  - Inconsistent data formats
  - Duplicate records
  - Erroneous data points
  - Data type inconsistencies
- Documented all data quality issues in a comprehensive assessment report
- Prioritized issues based on impact on subsequent analysis

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Imputed missing numerical values using appropriate methods (mean, median, or mode)
  - For categorical variables, applied domain-specific logic or used "Unknown" category
  - Removed records with critical missing data when necessary

- **Removing Duplicates**:
  - Identified and eliminated duplicate records
  - Preserved the most complete record when duplicates contained varying information

- **Standardizing Formats**:
  - Normalized date formats to ISO standard (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Standardized text fields (proper case, consistent abbreviations)
  - Unified units of measurement across datasets

- **Correcting Errors**:
  - Identified and fixed outliers and impossible values
  - Corrected misspellings in categorical variables
  - Resolved inconsistencies between related fields

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Type Conversion**:
  - Converted data types to appropriate formats (string to date, text to numeric)
  - Ensured consistent data types across related fields in different datasets

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created derived variables to enhance analysis capabilities
  - Calculated aggregate measures where appropriate
  - Developed categorical groupings for numerical ranges

- **Normalization**:
  - Applied scaling techniques to numerical variables
  - Created consistent category levels across datasets

### 4. Data Integration
- Developed a unified data model to connect the different datasets
- Created primary and foreign key relationships for joining datasets
- Merged datasets to create integrated views for specific analytical purposes
- Validated integrated datasets for completeness and accuracy

### 5. Workflow Automation
- Implemented AWS DataBrew to automate data cleaning operations
- Created reusable recipe files for consistent transformation across datasets
- Developed data pipeline for ongoing data refreshes

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **AWS DataBrew**: Primary tool for data profiling, cleaning, and transformation
- **AWS S3**: Storage for raw and processed datasets
- **AWS Glue**: ETL service for complex transformations and workflow orchestration
- **Python**: Custom scripts for specialized cleaning and transformation tasks
  - Pandas: Data manipulation library
  - NumPy: Numerical operations
  - Regex: Pattern matching for data cleaning
- **AWS QuickSight**: Data visualization for validation and quality assessment

### Python Data Cleaning Script (Sample)
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re

def clean_vancouver_dataset(file_path, output_path):
    """
    Clean the Vancouver dataset
    
    Parameters:
    file_path (str): Path to the input CSV file
    output_path (str): Path for the cleaned output file
    """
    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    # Standardize column names
    df.columns = [col.strip().replace(' ', '_').lower() for col in df.columns]
    
    # Handle missing values
    df['facilitycount'] = df['facilitycount'].fillna(0).astype(int)
    
    # Standardize facility types
    df['facilitytype'] = df['facilitytype'].str.title()
    
    # Apply regex pattern to standardize format
    pattern = r'(.+)\s+Park$'
    df['name'] = df['name'].apply(
        lambda x: re.sub(pattern, r'\1 Park', x) if isinstance(x, str) else x
    )
    
    # Remove duplicates
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['parkid', 'facilitytype'])
    
    # Save the cleaned dataset
    df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
    
    return df

# Example usage
clean_vancouver_dataset('raw_parks_data.csv', 'cleaned_parks_data.csv')
```
